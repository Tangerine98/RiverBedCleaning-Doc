   <h1><font color="#84C21B">Underwater Drone</font></h1><br>

   <p>Underwater drone are remote control underwater robots that driven by an individ-
ual on the surface. These robots are tethered by a series of wires. All Underwater
drones are equipped with a video camera, propulsion system and lights. The device
is equipped with a video camera, propulsion system and lights. Other equipment
is added depending on the specification required.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Underwater Drones, provides innovation and opens new market. It can be
used to inspect critical infrastructures like dams, bridges,underwater pipelines were
divers could not reach. It can be also used in rescue operations. That is if a person
falls down in a reservoir we can use this device in the entire area to find out the
person.</p>
 <br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Work to be done</font></h2><br>
<p>Currently we have implemented an underwater drone. What is left to be done is including robotic arm which can then be used in river bed cleaning by picking and placing items. If time permits, sensors like gyroscope, depth sensors can also be used for the same.</p>

<br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Design</font></h2><br>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">ROV Structure</font></h3><br>
<p>The structure dives through the water using its frame and propulsion system.
There are many factors that needed to be considered while designing the frame
and propulsion system.</p>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/ROV-Design.png" style="width:80%">
<legend>Block Diagram of ROV Structure</legend></p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">ROV Frame</font></h3><br>
<p>It is the skeleton of the underwater drone that we have designed. It supports the
propulsion system and the ballast. It is a cuboidal structure. Frame is usually an
open, box-shaped structure. Holes are included in the frame so that air trapped
can escape.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Materials Used</font></h3><br>
<p>Different materials like PVC and aluminium were available. As
PVC materials were easy accessible, cost effective, require less tools for opera-
8tion we prefer PVC over other materials. A better PVC known as uPVC were
considered as it was having better mechanical strength and less plasticity.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Dimensional Stability</font></h3><br>
<p>The frame used is a cuboidal structure which is symmetric about x and y axis.
It helps to maintain the stability of the system when different forces act from
different motors.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Shapes Used</font></h3><br>
<p>The shapes of the motor, frame(pipe), ballast, propulsion motor are of cylindrical
shape. The cylindrical shape helps in distributing hydraulic pressure uniformly
around surfaces.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Structural Stability</font></h3><br>
<p>For stability of the structure we use weights and float. Float are placed at top of
the frame as it provides positive buoyancy(poitive buoyancy is the property of a
material to float in water) and weights are placed at the bottom of the frame as it
provides negative buoyancy(negative buoyancy is the property of the material to
sink in water), therefore to maintain stability of the device we use the property of
neutral buoyancy. Weights are placed such a way by subtracting the whole weight
of the system.</p>
<p>After considering these factors, we selected the components used for designing
the frame:-</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">uPVC (unplasticized PolyVinyl Chloride)</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/uPVC.png" style="width:50%">
<legend>uPVC Pipes</legend></p>
<p>uPVC is a thermoplastic material derived from common salt and fossil fuels.
The pipe material has the longest track record of all plastic materials. The first
uPVC pipes weremade in the 1930s. Beginning in the 1950s, uPVC pipes were used
to replace corroded metal pipes and thus bring fresh drinking water to a growing
rural and later urban population. uPVC pipes are certified safe for drinking water
per NSF Standard 61 and used extensively for water distribution and transmission
pipelines throughout North America and around the world. uPVC is allowed for
waste lines in homes and is the most often used pipe for sanitary sewers.</p>
<p>Further pressure and non-pressure applications in the field of sewers, soil and
waste, gas(low pressure) and cable protection soon followed. The material’s con-
tribution to public health, hygiene and well-being has therefore been significant.</p>
<p>uPVC has high chemical resistance across its operating temperature range,
with a broad band of operating pressures. Max operating temperature is reported
at 140 degree farenheit, and max working pressure: 450 PSI. Due to its long-
term strength characteristics, high stiffness and cost effectiveness, uPVC systems
account for a large proportion of plastic piping installations and some estimations
put it that greater than two million miles of uPVC pipe are currently in service
across applications.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Weight</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/Weight.png" style="width:30%">
<legend>Lead Weights</legend></p>
<p>Weights are mainly used to control the vehicle without flipping. While considering about weights we need to consider about three concepts which will be mentioned below.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Center of Buoyancy</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/buoyancy.png" style="width:30%">
<legend>Center of Buoyancy</legend></p>
<p>The center of buoyancy(CB) is located at the geometric center of the portion of
the vessel that is underwater. The buoyant force acts upward through this point.
The center of gravity(CG) is located at the point where all the effects of gravity
acting on the vessel appear to concentrate. Total vessel weight act downward
through the CG.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Float</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/float.png" style="width:40%">
<legend>PVC Float</legend></p>
<p>Floatation is used to balance the sinking tendency of the other parts(which are
heavy) and thus it allows ROV to float effortlessly in mid-water. It conserves the
power that would otherwise be needed to lift the ROV.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Propulsion System</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/PS.png" style="width:60%">
<legend>Propulsion System</legend></p>
<p>The key factors to be considered in any propulsion system are: Number of
thrusters,Location of thrusters,Thrust (force) produced. The propulsion system
directly depends on the power supply. All underwater robots use electrical energy.
Power distribution system is used to channel the energy to various components
that need it. The thrusters are motorized propellers used to generate the forces
to propel the vehicle through the water. The proposed frame has a square shape
in which each of the propellers is placed in the 4 corners and one is placed at the
centre at the top. The main component of the propulsion system is a motor used
is bilge pump used along with a propeller.</p>
<p>In our design we have used the most often applied configuration - 5 thrusters
propulsion system. It allows us to divide the propulsion system into two indepen-
dent subsystems responsible for movements in the planes(horizontal and vertical).</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Motor - Bilge Pump</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/motor.png" style="width:60%">
<legend>Bilge Pump</legend></p>
<p>The bilge pumps together with propellers are used for propulsion. A bilge pump
is a water pump used to remove bilge water from boats. It mainly works in 12v
battery and it is already waterproofed. It is a non-automatic 1100GPH bilge
pumps which offer water evacuation activated by a panel. It includes Anti-Airlock
protection and exclusive moisture tight seals and marine grade wiring. It works in
Marine water upto 20ft depth. It’s also suitable for pond water pumping, water
research, solar water system etc.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Power Source</font></h3><br>
<p>A single motor used in the system uses 5 to 6 amps of current, so current output of
30 amps is required for proper functioning of the motors. For this purpose we use a
lithium ion car batteries which provide a peak current of 23ApH. The car batteries
are affordable. But these cant be used if you need the power source within the
ROV. </p>




<br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Control Box</font></h2><br>
<p>The control box helps the observer to control the rov which has been launched
into underwater. The main components which were used to build the control box
was:-</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microcontroller</li>
  <li>Relay</li>
  <li>Joystick</li>
</ul>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Microcontroller</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/Arduino.png" style="width:50%">
<legend>Arduino UNO</legend></p>
<p>The microcontroller used is Arduino Uno. It is an open source microcontroller
board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by
arduino cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output
pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits. The
board has 14 Digital pins,6 analog pins , and programmable with the Arduino IDE
via a USB cable. It accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. </p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Relay</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/relay.png" style="width:30%">
<legend>Relay</legend></p>
<p>A relay is an electrically operated switch. They use electromagnet to mechanically
operate a switch. In our control box we use relay for bidirectional control of our
driving motors, for this we use 5V two channel relay. </p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Joystick</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/joystick.png" style="width:30%">
<legend>Joystick</legend></p>
<p>The arduino joystick is similar to two potentiometers connected together , one
for vertical movement (y axis) and for horizontal movement (x axis). In our project
we use two joysticks. one for vertical movement along z plane and another one for
x and y axis movement in horizontal plane. </p>

  <p>The whole assembly of the tube, mounts,mirrors, and focuser needs 
to be rotated along the altitude, for this a clamp had to be designed 
that fits over the tubeand runs through a bearing between the two side 
arms.</p>
<p>The part was designed in Onshape, and printed in Dimension 1200 es.</p>

      <br></p><h3><font color="#84C21B">LCD Holder</font></h3><br>
      <p>The LCD has to be mounted on the base at an angle comfortable 
for viewing from the top. This factor along with the constraint of 
hieght of the box enclosure housing the PCB, led me to separate the LCD 
from the box enclosure and display it elsewhere.For this I designed a 
LCD mount in OnShape.</p>

      <br></p><h3><font color="#84C21B">Rod Clip</font></h3><br>
      <p>The Optical Tube Assembly (OTA), is built to be a collapsible ,
 so that it can be easily carried around.For this, when completely 
opened up, there needs to be a rod clips to keep the secondary part of 
the OTA in place, for this I designed a clip,that would latch on to the 
guide ring.</p>

<br></p><h2><font color="#84C21B">2D Design and CNC Cutting</font></h2><br>
<p>The base upon which the whole telescope assembly would rest would be designed and CNC by me. </p>
<p>The crucial design part here is to find out where to place the 
depressions for the motors.As a closed loop belt drive system is used to
 drive the base, it is essential to know the distance of the motor 
spindle from the centre of the base upon which a reduction gear would be
 mounted.</p>
<p>To find this out I used a formulae , that I used back in school.</p>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/330.jpg" style="width:40%">
</p><p>This gave me the distance between the two centres , when using a 400mm closed loop GT2 belt</p>
<p>I then drew a 2D DXF, in Onshape to have it CNC cut.</p>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/331.jpg" style="width:80%">
</p><p>The motors were given a 15 mm pit were they would be inserted.The base was cut in 18mm plywood.</p>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/sb.gif" style="width:50%">
</p><p>The base that has been designed and cut above, would be resting 
on another set of stationary base, rolling over a set of castor wheels.</p>

  <br></p><h2><font color="#84C21B">Laser Cutting</font></h2><br>
  <p>The drive system in the telescope is a belt system.For this I 
designed reduction gears so that the overall movement would be smoother 
and much finer resolution can be achieved.Moreover, the torque required 
would also decrease.</p>
  <p>The pulley I had for the GT2 timing belts had a 20 tooth, 12.7 pitch diameter. A simple method to make gears is on <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/www.geargenerator.com">GearGenerator.com</a> </p>

  </p><p>The gear has been designed so that it can be fixed onto the 
clamp designed, and would transfer the moment,inturn to turn the OTA.</p>

in similarly, but the gerar ratio was kept to 1:5, i.e 100 teeth.</p>

  <br></p><h2><font color="#84C21B">Electronics Production</font></h2><br>
  <p>I was involved in the producing a PCB which would house the motor 
drivers, LCD Display and the trigger switches for homing. This board 
would communicate with the Main board being produced by Suhail, from 
which it would recieve instructions on the text to display, and the 
number of steps to turn and the direction.The information regarding 
whether the north has been aligned (homing switch triggered), would be 
passsed on from my board onto the main board, where the calculation part
 happens. </p>
  <p>I used the board that I had made in networking week , keeping this in mind</p>
    <p class="pic"><img src="assets/334.jpg" style="width:80%">
    </p><p class="pic"><img src="assets/353.jpg" style="width:80%">
    </p><p>For more information on how I made, and the lessons learnt while making the board ,please refer to my <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabkochi/students/314/exercise16.html"> Networking Week</a>. </p>

<br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Programming</font></h2><br>

<p>The software of the telescope has mainly two parts.First is the 
calculation and logic behind finding the object and tracking it, and 
Secondly the communication part between the app and the two boards.</p>
<p>For the programming part , I would be involved in doing the 
calaculation and logic part of the software.Because,astronomy was quite a
 new topic for me ,it took some days in understanding the logic behind 
tracking an object and get a sense of the differential equations used. </p>
<p>The "Finding", part was done before by myself during the machine 
design week, which was a set of formulas,changed into code.The major 
difference in the GO-TO system, from our group project phase, is the 
implementation of a repository of celestial objects in the the 
app.Previously, all the coordinates of our location, the celestial 
body's location , the date and time, was hardcoded into the 
program.However, in this project, these data would b fetced real time, 
from the app.  </p>
<p>The basic fundamentals of astronomy used for this project is explained in the machine week.</p>
<p>The input recieved by the program would be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right Ascension(Celestial Body)[RA]</li>
  <li>Declination(Celestial Body)[DEC]</li>
  <li>Current Date</li>
  <li>Current Time</li>
  <li>Current GPS location[LAT,LON]</li>
</ul>
<p>THe small catch over here is that , the program assumes the mobile on
 which the app is running to be near the telescope, which it would be if
 not the bluetooth wouldnt work.</p>
<p>Given the inputs required, there are certain steps to get the Hour 
Angle, which would later be used to find the altitude and azimuth 
angles. </p>
<p>The final formula to be used is :</p>
  <p class="pic"><img src="assets/336.jpg" style="width:80%">
    </p><pre>//to find Hour Angle (HA)
  //HA = LST - RA
  float get_ha() {
    float lst_ = get_lst_value(ip_long, ip_t, ip_date);
    float ra_ = ra_to_degree(ip_ra);
    float ha = lst_ - ra_;
    //float ha = (lst_ - ra_ + 360)- ((int)((lst_ - ra_ + 360)/360))*360;
    return ha;
    }

//to calculate Altitude(ALT)
 float get_altitude() {
   float alt = asin(sin(dec_to_degree(ip_dec)*pi/180)*sin(ip_lat*pi/180)+cos(dec_to_degree(ip_dec)*pi/180)*cos(ip_lat*pi/180)*cos(get_ha()*pi/180));
   return alt*180/pi;
  }

//to calculate Azimuth(AZ)
float get_azimuth() {
  float a,az,ha;
  a = acos((sin(dec_to_degree(ip_dec)*pi/180)-sin(get_altitude()*pi/180)*sin(ip_lat*pi/180))/(cos(get_altitude()*pi/180)*cos(ip_lat*pi/180)));
  a = a*180/pi;
  ha = get_ha();
  if (sin(ha*pi/180) &gt; 0) {
      az = 360-a;
    }
    else {
       az = a;
      }

  return az;
  }
</pre>
    <p>This would give the location of the celestial body,however, now to track the object throught the night is the challenge.</p>
    <p>We would be using a Dobsonian mount for our telescope, which 
would mean our OTA ,isnt aligned to our equator.Hence for tracking an 
object both the motors would have to work, unlike equatorial mounts, 
which would only require movement along one axis.</p>
    <p>The velocities of the altitude and azimuth coordinates while tracking the object would be:</p>
    <p class="pic"><img src="assets/339.jpg" style="width:50%">
</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Z: Zenith Distance</li>
  <li>A: Azimuth Angle</li>
  <li>phi: Latitude[LAT]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The corresponding accelaration of the alt-az coordinates are:</p>
    <p class="pic"><img src="assets/340.jpg" style="width:50%">
      </p><p>From the above accelaration equation is evident that the 
sign changes at the transit ,and the accelaration would near infinity at
 the zenith point.</p>
      <p>Hence, this reveals a major drawback in using a Dobsonian mount
 for tracking,i.e, When the object moves past the zenith, there is small
 inaccessible blind spot around the zenith point, as the azimuth angle 
changes the sign.Here the accelartion would tend to infinity.</p>
      <p>The angles from around 89.5 degrees to 90.5 is generally considered to be the blind spot.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To reduce the complication,in doing double differentiation, I 
decided to use a less effecient way of calculating the real time values 
by running the G0-TO function in a loop with a delay of 2 minutes.This 
however, would result in not a smooth tracking, but rather a choppier 
one, but in a scale of 12 hours tracking , the frame captured reduction 
would not be noticed .</p>
<p>In my method, once the track option is enabled in the request 
forwareded from the app, the program enters into a loop, wherein it 
would recalculate the position of the object every 2 minutes, convert it
 into steps.Then, find the difference of the current number of steps 
with the previous amount and then move the difference.The newly 
calculated step count would then be stored as the default value.This 
process goes on in repetitive cycle, until the object is out of sight of
 horizon, or until stopped.</p>
<pre>alt_val = alt_val - al_delta;
      azimuth_val = azimuth_val - az_delta;
</pre>
<p>The above line of code finds the difference between the current value of steps and the newly calculated ones</p>
<pre>al_delta = al_delta + alt_val;
       az_delta = az_delta + azimuth_val;</pre>
       <p>The above line of code stores the newly calculated value as the default value, this value would serve in the next iteration.</p>
<pre> if (ip_t[1]&lt;59) {
        ip_t[1] = ip_t[1] + 1;
      } else {
        ip_t[1] = 0;
        if (ip_t[0]&lt;23) {
          ip_t[0] = ip_t[0] + 1;
        } else {
            ip_t[0] = 0;
            if (ip_date[0]&lt;30) {
                ip_date[0] = ip_date[0] + 1;
              }else {
                 ip_date[0] = 1;
                 ip_date[1] = ip_date[1] +1;
               }
              </pre>


<p>The above line of code , takes into account the change in time when 
clock passes through one hour  or one day.For eg. when the time is 
20:59, then next iteration has to be 21:00</p>
<p>For the time being , it has been limited to 30 days in a month, I 
would later refine the code so that it takes it the alternating 30 
&amp;31 days, and would account for leap years and such.</p>
<br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Assembling</font></h2><br>
<p>To get started , I began with the base of the telescope. A 25 mm rod 
was fixed onto the stationary base, using Araldite, a hardner</p>
  <p class="pic"><img src="assets/344.jpg" style="width:35%">
    </p><p>The homing switch , which is used to trigger, when the telescope is aligned to the zenith and the north had to be assembled.</p>
    <p>For this, a mechanical switch with a wheel on the contact surface
 is used , so that it permits 360 degree rotation, without the 
limitation of a regular switch that would sacrifice some degrees of 
rotation, for its placement.</p>
    <p>A smooth sliding contour has been laser cut , that would go over the wheel of the switch</p>
    <p class="pic"><img src="assets/345.jpg" style="width:35%">
      </p><p>The next task is to tension the belt drives, for the lower 
base the design in itself would take care of the tensioning, however, 
the belt drive of the altitude angle, haas to be done manually, because 
it is an open loop belt</p>
     <p class="pic"><img src="assets/346.jpg" style="width:35%">
      </p><p>The belt used for driving the altitude axis is an open one,
 hence a joiner had to be made .The belt joiner is a laser cut negative 
profile of the GT2 belt.To adjust the tension further I downloaded a 
belt tensioner model from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1780636"> here.</a>The belt can be tightened by screwing in on the belt.</p>
        <p class="pic"><img src="assets/359.jpg" style="width:35%">
          </p><p>To make the Optical Tube Assembly (OTA),THE 1 meter 
long PVC tube had to be cut into two sections of approx 60cm and another
 of 15 cm, based on the 120cm focal length of the mirrors used.</p>
          <p class="pic"><img src="assets/365.jpg" style="width:75%">
            </p><p>To give an aesthetic look to the project ,the wooden 
parts as well as the PVC tube has been painted.However, as the PVC tube 
was very smooth, I was apprenhensive about the paint sticking onto the 
surface.So, to have a bit of rough finishing on th etube, I sand blasted
 it.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src="assets/364.jpg" style="width:80%">
              <legend>Sanblasting the pipes.</legend>
              </p><p>The internal surface of the OTA shouldnt refelect light, and therefore painting it black,was essential </p>
                  <p class="pic"><img src="assets/366.jpg" style="width:80%">
                    </p><p>The wooden arms and base were painted for an aesthetic appeal.</p>
                      <p class="pic"><img src="assets/367.jpg" style="width:80%">
  </p><p>The challenge in using a refelective telescope , is the 
alignment of the primary and seconadary mirrors.Moreover, as this 
project has two units of tubes attached by aluminum rods, it would be an
 extra effort in aligning the guide brackets such that the two pieces 
along with the mirror fall in the same line.</p>

<br></p><h2><font color="#84C21B">Errors Made</font></h2><br>
<p>Well, over the course of this project development, there are a 
plethora of errors that I have committed, some are rather silly, while 
other may be due to lack of planning.Some of them are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Azimuth axis Belt tension </u>: As I had mentioned above, where
 I used the common tangent formula for finding the distance between the 
centre of the motor spindle and the central rod.Well, that didnt 
actually work out exactly, but it was a very close approximate , this 
may have been caused by:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The formula accounts for a straight line perfectly in line, 
which I thought would be applicable for a tensioned belt,there could 
have abeen a small sag, which changed the dimensions</li>
    <li>Another reason, I suspect is that,the approximations I had done in calculations would have caught up. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The issue was resol;ved by making the gear with a smaller 
diameter.I changed the number of teeth to 95, which brought the gear 
ratio to be 4.75. </p>
  <li><u>Guide Rings Alignment</u> : The guide rings that align the 
aluminium rods was not aligned properly in the first try.This was caused
 mainly, because I had aligned the guide rings to be parallel the the 
tube.However, the tuve wasnt cut exactly inline.THis caused the 
aluminium rods to be at different heights slightly, and therby the 
primary and secondary mirror to be misaligned. </li>
  <p>This issue was corrected by aligning the guide rings properly,and reassembling the rods. </p>
  <li><u>Outer Pass issue</u>: This was a really silly mistake , that I 
had done. I had given an outer pass cut for the motor hole and the hole 
for passing the bearing.</li>
  <p class="pic"><img src="assets/357.jpg" style="width:50%">
    <legend>The base with a very loose fit holes &amp; pockets</legend>
  </p><p>I then had to recut the base with inside pass, to get a tight fit of the motors and bearing.</p>
  <li><u>Rough Castor Wheels:</u>The castor wheels that we had used was 
of poor quality, hence rotating the base was quite an effort for the 
motor. I resolved this by using bigger castor with big ping pong balls 
kind of wheels, also I am planning on making the gear bigger so that 
there is lesser load on the motor . </li>
  </ul>

<br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Future Scope</font></h2><br>
<p>Current system has a control
system with all components on the land, an alternation include where the motion
controllers alone are put on the land, and other components inside the system with
a waterproof sealing. But this also require an extra expense on the tight casing
which is a hard task. The motor used can be upgraded from brushed motors to
brush less motors which will provide high power. An update on the frame material
from uPVC to aluminium frame is also recommended. An important update which
can be included is replacement of relay with motor drivers. In our project we use
24 relays instead of motor drivers as they were very expensive.</p>

    <h2><font color="#84C21B">Conclusion</font></h2>
        <br>
        <p> I suggest you change this conclusion to something more simple, smaller and understandable</p>
        <p>ROVs are unoccupied, usually highly manoeuvrable, and operated by a crew
either aboard a vessel/floating platform or on proximate land. They are common
in deepwater industries such as offshore hydrocarbon extraction. They are linked
to a host ship by a neutrally buoyant tether or, often when working in rough
conditions or in deeper water, a load-carrying umbilical cable is used along with a
tether management system (TMS). The TMS is either a garage-like device which
contains the ROV during lowering through the splash zone or, on larger work-
class ROVs, a separate assembly which sits on top of the ROV. The purpose of the
TMS is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there
are underwater currents is minimized. The umbilical cable is an armored cable
that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric
power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used,
the TMS then relays the signals and power for the ROV down the tether cable.
Once at the ROV, the electric power is distributed between the components of
the ROV. However, in high-power applications, most of the electric power drives a
high-power electric motor which drives a hydraulic pump. The pump is then used
for propulsion and to power equipment such as torque tools and manipulator arms
where electric motors would be too difficult to implement subsea. Most ROVs
are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is
commonly added to expand the vehicle’s capabilities. These may include sonar’s,
magnetometers, a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and
instruments that measure water clarity, water temperature, water density, sound
velocity, light penetration, and temperature. Also optical-stereo cameras have been
mounted on ROVs in order to improve the pilots’ perception of the underwater
scenario.</p>
