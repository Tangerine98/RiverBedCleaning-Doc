   <h1><font color="#84C21B">River Bed Cleaner</font></h1><br>

   <p>I suggest you change your abstract to suit that of a river bed cleaner and not just of an underwater drone.</p>

   <p>Underwater drone are remote control underwater robots that driven by an individ-
ual on the surface. These robots are tethered by a series of wires. All Underwater
drones are equipped with a video camera, propulsion system and lights. The device
is equipped with a video camera, propulsion system and lights. Other equipment
is added depending on the specification required.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Underwater Drones, provides innovation and opens new market. It can be
used to inspect critical infrastructures like dams, bridges,underwater pipelines were
divers could not reach. It can be also used in rescue operations. That is if a person
falls down in a reservoir we can use this device in the entire area to find out the
person.</p>
 <br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Work to be done</font></h2><br>
<p>Currently we have implemented an underwater drone. What is left to be done is including a robotic arm which can then be used in river bed cleaning by picking and placing items. If time permits, sensors like gyroscope, depth sensors can also be used for the same.</p>

<br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Design</font></h2>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">ROV Structure</font></h3><br>
<p>The structure dives through the water using its frame and propulsion system.
There are many factors that needed to be considered while designing the frame
and propulsion system.</p>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/ROV-Design.png" style="width:80%">
<legend>Block Diagram of ROV Structure</legend></p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">ROV Frame</font></h3><br>
<p>It is the skeleton of the underwater drone that we have designed. It supports the
propulsion system and the ballast. It is a cuboidal structure. Frame is usually an
open, box-shaped structure. Holes are included in the frame so that air trapped
can escape.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Materials Used</font></h3><br>
<p>Different materials like PVC and aluminium were available. As
PVC materials were easy accessible, cost effective, require less tools for opera-
8tion we prefer PVC over other materials. A better PVC known as uPVC were
considered as it was having better mechanical strength and less plasticity.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Dimensional Stability</font></h3><br>
<p>The frame used is a cuboidal structure which is symmetric about x and y axis.
It helps to maintain the stability of the system when different forces act from
different motors.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Shapes Used</font></h3><br>
<p>The shapes of the motor, frame(pipe), ballast, propulsion motor are of cylindrical
shape. The cylindrical shape helps in distributing hydraulic pressure uniformly
around surfaces.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Structural Stability</font></h3><br>
<p>For stability of the structure we use weights and float. Float are placed at top of
the frame as it provides positive buoyancy(poitive buoyancy is the property of a
material to float in water) and weights are placed at the bottom of the frame as it
provides negative buoyancy(negative buoyancy is the property of the material to
sink in water), therefore to maintain stability of the device we use the property of
neutral buoyancy. Weights are placed such a way by subtracting the whole weight
of the system.</p>
<p>After considering these factors, we selected the components used for designing
the frame:-</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">uPVC (unplasticized PolyVinyl Chloride)</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/uPVC.png" style="width:50%">
<legend>uPVC Pipes</legend></p>
<p>uPVC is a thermoplastic material derived from common salt and fossil fuels.
The pipe material has the longest track record of all plastic materials. The first
uPVC pipes weremade in the 1930s. Beginning in the 1950s, uPVC pipes were used
to replace corroded metal pipes and thus bring fresh drinking water to a growing
rural and later urban population. uPVC pipes are certified safe for drinking water
per NSF Standard 61 and used extensively for water distribution and transmission
pipelines throughout North America and around the world. uPVC is allowed for
waste lines in homes and is the most often used pipe for sanitary sewers.</p>
<p>Further pressure and non-pressure applications in the field of sewers, soil and
waste, gas(low pressure) and cable protection soon followed. The material’s con-
tribution to public health, hygiene and well-being has therefore been significant.</p>
<p>uPVC has high chemical resistance across its operating temperature range,
with a broad band of operating pressures. Max operating temperature is reported
at 140 degree farenheit, and max working pressure: 450 PSI. Due to its long-
term strength characteristics, high stiffness and cost effectiveness, uPVC systems
account for a large proportion of plastic piping installations and some estimations
put it that greater than two million miles of uPVC pipe are currently in service
across applications.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Weight</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/Weight.png" style="width:30%">
<legend>Lead Weights</legend></p>
<p>Weights are mainly used to control the vehicle without flipping. While considering about weights we need to consider about three concepts which will be mentioned below.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Center of Buoyancy</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/buoyancy.png" style="width:30%">
<legend>Center of Buoyancy</legend></p>
<p>The center of buoyancy(CB) is located at the geometric center of the portion of
the vessel that is underwater. The buoyant force acts upward through this point.
The center of gravity(CG) is located at the point where all the effects of gravity
acting on the vessel appear to concentrate. Total vessel weight act downward
through the CG.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Float</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/float.png" style="width:40%">
<legend>PVC Float</legend></p>
<p>Floatation is used to balance the sinking tendency of the other parts(which are
heavy) and thus it allows ROV to float effortlessly in mid-water. It conserves the
power that would otherwise be needed to lift the ROV.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Propulsion System</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/PS.png" style="width:60%">
<legend>Propulsion System</legend></p>
<p>The key factors to be considered in any propulsion system are: Number of
thrusters,Location of thrusters,Thrust (force) produced. The propulsion system
directly depends on the power supply. All underwater robots use electrical energy.
Power distribution system is used to channel the energy to various components
that need it. The thrusters are motorized propellers used to generate the forces
to propel the vehicle through the water. The proposed frame has a square shape
in which each of the propellers is placed in the 4 corners and one is placed at the
centre at the top. The main component of the propulsion system is a motor used
is bilge pump used along with a propeller.</p>
<p>In our design we have used the most often applied configuration - 5 thrusters
propulsion system. It allows us to divide the propulsion system into two indepen-
dent subsystems responsible for movements in the planes(horizontal and vertical).</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Motor - Bilge Pump</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/motor.png" style="width:60%">
<legend>Bilge Pump</legend></p>
<p>The bilge pumps together with propellers are used for propulsion. A bilge pump
is a water pump used to remove bilge water from boats. It mainly works in 12v
battery and it is already waterproofed. It is a non-automatic 1100GPH bilge
pumps which offer water evacuation activated by a panel. It includes Anti-Airlock
protection and exclusive moisture tight seals and marine grade wiring. It works in
Marine water upto 20ft depth. It’s also suitable for pond water pumping, water
research, solar water system etc.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Power Source</font></h3><br>
<p>A single motor used in the system uses 5 to 6 amps of current, so current output of
30 amps is required for proper functioning of the motors. For this purpose we use a
lithium ion car batteries which provide a peak current of 23ApH. The car batteries
are affordable. But these cant be used if you need the power source within the
ROV. </p>




<br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Control Box</font></h2><br>
<p>The control box helps the observer to control the rov which has been launched
into underwater. The main components which were used to build the control box
was:-</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microcontroller</li>
  <li>Relay</li>
  <li>Joystick</li>
</ul>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Microcontroller</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/Arduino.png" style="width:50%">
<legend>Arduino UNO</legend></p>
<p>The microcontroller used is Arduino Uno. It is an open source microcontroller
board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by
arduino cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output
pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits. The
board has 14 Digital pins,6 analog pins , and programmable with the Arduino IDE
via a USB cable. It accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. </p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Relay</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/relay.png" style="width:30%">
<legend>Relay</legend></p>
<p>A relay is an electrically operated switch. They use electromagnet to mechanically
operate a switch. In our control box we use relay for bidirectional control of our
driving motors, for this we use 5V two channel relay. </p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Joystick</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/joystick.png" style="width:30%">
<legend>Joystick</legend></p>
<p>The arduino joystick is similar to two potentiometers connected together , one
for vertical movement (y axis) and for horizontal movement (x axis). In our project
we use two joysticks. one for vertical movement along z plane and another one for
x and y axis movement in horizontal plane. </p>

<br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Implementation</font></h2><br>
<p>The construction of the underwater drone was done in the following six phases:-

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Phase I</font></h3><br>
<p>Initially we started by building the frame. We used pvc pipes for initial structure
building, as pvc was easy to cut and fix by ourselves it was used for all the trial
build of frame. We had built many frame structures and after their trials in water
we modified the structure as required.</p>
<p>Then we came to realize that the PVC we used wasn’t strong enough. It was not
able to withstand the weight of our motor, float or even the lead weights. Thus
we started looking for a better frame material. Unplasticized Polyvinyl Chloride
(uPVC) was chosen then as it was having a high strength to weight ratio. uPVC
pipes were having less plasticity hence was less flexible giving us high strength.
uPVC also has many advantages like good impact resistance, high strength, doesnt
corrode, has all weather UV resistance etc..</p>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/final_frame.png" style="width:70%">
<legend>Final Frame</legend></p>
<p>The frame we build should also must be symmetric. The reason it should be
symmetric is that it will greatly effect the stability of the system when other com-
ponents like floats, weights, pumps are attached to the frame. Thus a symmetric
structure was designed with a length and breadth of 30 cm. Height was fixed to
20 cm.Pipes were provided with holes to avoid air trapping inside the pipes which
will greatly affect the neutral buoyancy of the system when it is submerged hence
stability will be lost. A single air bubble trapped inside could spoil the entire
stability of the system. Joining of the uPVC pipes were done using nuts and bolts
of 1/2 inch size as it will help us to repair the frame when needed.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Phase II</font></h3><br>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/weights.png" style="width:50%">
<legend>Weights</legend></p>
<p>After the frame was build, next the floats and weights were placed. The proce-
dure followed was as follows: Initially the floats where fixed above the frame using
clamps. Here we used two floats at two ends of the structure at equal distance.
Secondly, we added the motors to four pillars of the frame and fixed the vertical
thruster, next we placed the frame in water, now the structure which was slightly
floating was provided with lead weights until neutral buoyancy was achieved, the
corresponding lead weights where then fixed on the frame. The principle of keep-
ing positive buoyant materials on upper half of the structure and negative buoyant
on the lower half is followed as it will help the system not to flip under the water
under certain circumstances. The final structure was then immersed in the water
and forces were given along different directions to check whether the system is
stable or not.</p>
<p>The principle of keeping positive buoyant materials on upper half of the struc-
ture and negative buoyant on the lower half is followed as it will help the system

then immersed in the water and forces were given along different directions to
check whether the system is stable or not.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Phase III</font></h3><br>
<p>Here the building of propulsion motors from bilge pump is explained. The motor
shaft is made to expose out of the frame by removing the ABS covering of the
pump. Next the impeller is removed for fixing the custom made propeller.</p>
<p>Propeller is made by 3D printing. Different designs were used and tested. We
used Fusion360, a software for designing.</p>
<p class="pic"><img src="assets/img/try_buoyancy.png" style="width:70%">
<legend>Trial to determine neutral buoyancy</legend></p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Phase IV</font></h3><br>
<p>The next phase we came across was the arrangement of the propulsion system. We
used four motors for horizontal movement along x-axis and y-axis, and a single
motor for vertical movement. The arrangement of four horizontal thrusters make
sure that equal weight is distributed along all corners of the frame and the vertical
thruster must be placed at the centre of the horizontal plane at the point where the
diagonals intersect. The vertical thruster is placed in such a height that propeller
alone stands above floats. The horizontal propellers where then placed along each
corners as shown as in the figure. Anticlockwise and clockwise direction of each
motors with different sequence is performed to achieve foreword, backward, left,
and right directions of motion. The forward motion of the system is achieved by
rotating all horizontal motors on similar direction. The movement to the right
is achieved by paired rotation of diagonally opposite thrusters along zero-th and
third sub planes.</p>

<br><h3><font color="#84C21B">Phase V</font></h3><br>
<p>Here we discuss the tethering,designing of control box and fixing of camera in the
system the tethering cable used is copper wire which was used to extent the motor wires. Now the wire connections are done in the control box as shown in the figure</p>
<p>The camera used in the ROV is an endoscopy camera. The camera was chosen
as it was already waterproofed and can directly be connected to smartphones via
cable. It provides a smart vision to record video and audio which can be directly
stored to your Android phone. It is convenient for observation and follow-up
analysis. It has a light button used to control 6 LED lights to work in dark areas.
It’s a IP67 waterproof camera with micro to USB line, also works with computer.
It is an ideal solution for underwater camera.</p>

<p>The section discusses about wiring connection of tether. The wire provided by
the bilge pumps were marine graded and only have 1.5m. The remaining length was achieved using copper wires which where used for commercial wiring. The
challenge we faced here was the sealing of joining of two wires in underwater. M-
seal, super glue all failed and the sealing was at-last achieved using plastic tubescovering the wire bond with epoxy resin sealing both the sides along with shrinking
tubes.</p>

<p>After all the phases above mentioned were compiled together for the formation
of our ROV. Our ROV was tested in a water tank, using the control box. All the
forward, Backward, Left, Right directions of motions were achieved. The main
challenge we faced was to push the Rov into the depths and pull the Rov out
to the water surface. As the vertical motions were controlled by a single motor,
achieving balance was a challenge. After many trails and fails we have achieved
balances. Next its the neutral buoyancy which played an important limitation to
the tests. We came to understand after several trails that the neutral buoyancy
always changes, as the volume of the water body where changing. Thus weight
balancing where needed according to the water body we were testing. It’s the
propeller which made the next challenge. As the propellers were designed by
ourselves, and due to the lack of quality of 3D printing material change in the
inner radius of motor shaft were observed after several trails. Here the Dshaft of
the designed propeller decayed to round shape which made it to slip away from the
motor shaft during the trails. Later we made the propellers with a better material
and applied epoxy resin before it’s fixing. Thus the expansion was reduced and
propeller lasted longer. The endoscopy camera which we were using provided us
with a good quality of vision more than we expected. But the limitation was
provided by the length of wire it provided. As these wire were professionally
installed, we couldn’t extend it.</p>











<br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Future Scope</font></h2><br>
<p>Current system has a control
system with all components on the land, an alternation include where the motion
controllers alone are put on the land, and other components inside the system with
a waterproof sealing. But this also require an extra expense on the tight casing
which is a hard task. The motor used can be upgraded from brushed motors to
brush less motors which will provide high power. An update on the frame material
from uPVC to aluminium frame is also recommended. An important update which
can be included is replacement of relay with motor drivers. In our project we use
24 relays instead of motor drivers as they were very expensive.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion section  -->
    <br><h2><font color="#84C21B">Conclusion</font></h2>
        <br>
        <p> I suggest you change this conclusion to something more simple, smaller and understandable</p>
        <p>ROVs are unoccupied, usually highly manoeuvrable, and operated by a crew
either aboard a vessel/floating platform or on proximate land. They are common
in deepwater industries such as offshore hydrocarbon extraction. They are linked
to a host ship by a neutrally buoyant tether or, often when working in rough
conditions or in deeper water, a load-carrying umbilical cable is used along with a
tether management system (TMS). The TMS is either a garage-like device which
contains the ROV during lowering through the splash zone or, on larger work-
class ROVs, a separate assembly which sits on top of the ROV. The purpose of the
TMS is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there
are underwater currents is minimized. The umbilical cable is an armored cable
that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric
power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used,
the TMS then relays the signals and power for the ROV down the tether cable.
Once at the ROV, the electric power is distributed between the components of
the ROV. However, in high-power applications, most of the electric power drives a
high-power electric motor which drives a hydraulic pump. The pump is then used
for propulsion and to power equipment such as torque tools and manipulator arms
where electric motors would be too difficult to implement subsea. Most ROVs
are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is
commonly added to expand the vehicle’s capabilities. These may include sonar’s,
magnetometers, a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and
instruments that measure water clarity, water temperature, water density, sound
velocity, light penetration, and temperature. Also optical-stereo cameras have been
mounted on ROVs in order to improve the pilots’ perception of the underwater
scenario.</p>
